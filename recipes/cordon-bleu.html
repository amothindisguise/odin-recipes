    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><a href="https://veenaazmanov.com/chicken-cordon-bleu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cordon bleu</a> is a classic dish that consists of chicken or veal fillets stuffed with ham and cheese, breaded and fried to a golden brown, often served with a creamy sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Chicken Rolls</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>8 slices cooked ham</li>
        <li>4 slices Swiss cheese, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cornflakes cereal crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Make the chicken rolls: Place each chicken breast half between sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet to about 1/8 inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Place a piece of cheese on each ham slice and sprinkle lightly with thyme and salt and pepper to taste. Roll up seasoned ham and cheese jellyroll-style, then roll each chicken breast with ham and cheese inside. Tuck in ends and fasten with toothpicks.</li>
        <li>Place melted butter in a small bowl and place cereal crumbs in a shallow dish or bowl. Dip each chicken roll in butter, then roll in crumbs, turning to coat thoroughly. Place coated rolls in the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is golden brown and juices run clear, about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, prepare the cordon bleu sauce: Mix together condensed soup, sour cream, and lemon juice in a small saucepan. Heat over low heat, stirring occasionally, until combined.</li>
        <li>Serve sauce hot over chicken rolls. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
